Abundance of hydrogen in rubber's molecular chain make it perfectr to be examined by MRI.
If an amorphous material like body can be examined by MRI, then rubber also can be examined by MRI.
In automobile and in various fields, rubber is the heart for many parts.
Using MRI we can examine whether rubber under use is having the proper density in the required areas.
It is also possible to find internal cracks using MRI. This will not only give accurate results.
It also gives density changes. This will help us to find where the stress accumulates. This can lead us to new 
methods where we can measure the change in the rubber parts spontaneously. 

In automobile industry some parts will go under test for 1000 cycles/hits . Using MRI we can reduce this 
cycles count. We can examine the rubber part after 500 cycles for its internal cracks. We also can check for internal 
damage in the rubber parts at any time between these cycles or at the end of these cycles.

Usine some stress/starin related theories and some other theories like FiniteElementMethod we can bring this into
 much more advanced measuing technique. 

This can be extended to scan all the other available non-ferro magnetic tools, thereby we can get 3-d measurements.

This will be very useful in crash testing. Steel model can't be used in order to use MRI testing.So a car must be
made with non-ferrous materials but sistically,dynamically it should behave like original. make a rash testing on this one.
Then examine it using MRI , then we will get the areas which got the damage. This will help in making the good design.

The same can be extended to glass,plastic materials.
