Many vaccines are made by killing the viruses and using their dead bodies. These dead bodies are called as vaccine.unfortunaterly some times these dead bodies are not 100% dead. Some of them will be alive.

At that time injecting vacibes means injecting the virus. Scan the vaccine using MRI. Some virus needs certain bio chemical for reproduction. 

Put these chemicals into the vaccine and scan them. If te scan result is constant witin the human body temperature range, then the vaccine is safe in other wordds those viruses are completely dead. Otherwise dont use that vaccine.
