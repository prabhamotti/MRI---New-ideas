MRI can be employed to aluminum also. Because it is a paramagnetic material. In avionics industry aluminium is all.
Aluminium's ductility makes it very suitable for making planes. But in testing grounds it is hard to find cracks or change 
due to stress. if we use MRI for this then finding internal defects will be piece of cake for the testing persons.
And we can check the changes spontaneously.

There are certain things in avionics field called as smart materials. Very interesting things.
 Usig MRI we can check their efficiency spontaneously.

MRI can be highly utilised in wind tunnel related testings.
